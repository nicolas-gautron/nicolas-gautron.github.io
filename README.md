## Who am I?

&nbsp;

âœ” 10 years of experience in PHP.

âœ” Open to all technologies.

&nbsp;

Followed by a professional coach during two years, I had the chance to experience several psychological tools and models. While the Process Communication represents the way we all communicate with each other, in my case, I find the result really representative of my whole personality:
##### Base: thinker at 100%

I like to organize things, to test new processes or methodologies, to fail, to test again and to adapt to new situations. I'm quite direct in my communication and while I'm able to assume the political part of my job, I avoid it as much as I can.

##### Empathetic / harmoniser at 100%

As a former team leader and manager, there is no ritual more important for me than the ones allowing the feedback and the global communication: retrospective, one-to-one, mood of the week, team health check. I liked to involve my team in the decisions, basing some meetings on formats inspired by the holacracy world and encouraging everyone to speak freely. I trusted my team members and their professionalism, giving them the leadership on their subjects, making them autonomous as much as possible, allowing them to communicate with partners and to deploy some features in production without my approval.

##### Current phase: dreamer / imaginer at 85%

If someone asked me the part of my job I prefer, I would definitely answer: the architectural conception of a subject. I love Identifying and understanding both the business and technical concepts and their responsibilities. In my job, I value the continuous apprenticeship of the business as much as the technical aspects. Creating an ubiquitous language and understanding the separation and the links between the concerns is for me a key success factor for the long term maintainability and testability of a platform. I often need some quiet time to think and to conceptualize this kind of things on my own before bringing the subject to the team.

Feel free to contact me for more information.

Have a nice day ðŸ˜Š.
